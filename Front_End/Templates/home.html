            <h2>Dataset</h2>
            <p>To train our model, we used the Yelp public dataset which is a conglomerate of 6,685,900 reviews for 192,609 businesses. </p>

            <h2>Our Model</h2>
            <p>We performed a sentiment analysis on the text from our reviews to predict the rating of the user. The first 150k reviews and ratings (representative sample) of the Yelp dataset was first preprocessed to exclude all uppercase letters, stop words, numbers, and apostrophes. The Porter stemming algorithm was also applied to remove inflectional endings of words. A Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) calculation was then applied to the reviews. Predictions were made using multinomial logistic regression at 400 max iterations. </p>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>Introduces the idea of a suggestive rating. This is similar to an autofill feature allowing the user to review their experience at
            an restaurant or service and the system will provide them with a suggested rating so they can judge whether their rating aligns with their review.</p>
